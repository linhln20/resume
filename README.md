# About me

My name is Lam Ngoc Linh. If you can see this words. That mean I'm opening to work.
## Experience
Despite being a latecomer to the IT Business Analyst, I have accumulated over six years of diverse professional experience across multiple domains, including business, administration, marketing, accounting, CRM, retail, HR, and education.

Personality:
- Analytical mindset with strong problem-solving capabilities and attention to detail.
- Quick learner, highly adaptable to new technologies and business domains.
- Excellent communication skills, able to bridge technical and non-technical stakeholders.
- Strong sense of responsibility and ability to work under pressure to meet deadlines.
- Collaborative team player with experience in cross-functional environments.

## Personal projects
### 1. EasyGo
EasyGo is a mobile application that aggregates and compares ride options from multiple ride-hailing providers, enabling users to search, compare prices, select trips, and book rides within a single platform.
The project focuses on optimizing user experience, standardizing APIs across partners, and ensuring accurate fare comparison in real time.
I participated as a Business Analyst, responsible for requirements analysis, user flow design, API definition, and documentation (BRD/SRS, use cases, BPMN).

## Why I tranfer to a Business Analyst?
My background is business, marketing. But I start with start up companies. I have opportunity to join in website development, where I have to become a fullstack as BA, Tester. 
I started as a Tester, and throughout my work, I naturally stepped into BA responsibilities — asking questions, identifying system gaps, and proposing improvements. 

My manager, Mr. Quang, recognized my potential and mentored me toward becoming a Business Analyst.
I’ve realized that the BA role is the right path for me, and I am fully committed to pursuing it. I started a Business Analysis course in September 2025 and will complete it by the end of February 2026.
## Why choose me?
Although I don’t come from an IT background, I successfully developed four company websites — Kaleidoscope, DigiNexus, GreenDS, and Dakmark — from A to Z while I was a staff member. Each project was delivered within 2 to 6 months, even though I had no formal technical training. 

Coming from a marketing foundation, I gained exposure to multiple business domains and developed strong soft skills. 

I believe this multidisciplinary background gives me a unique advantage — enabling me to approach stakeholders and requirements with a broader, business-driven perspective that many IT BAs spend years to build.

With a fast-learning mindset, I independently acquired commodity and futures trading knowledge within one month when I joined Bolt Tech. During my five months there, I served as the sole Business Analyst, writing full Functional Specification Documents, diagrams, and flowcharts end-to-end.
I’m eager to bring this capability and drive to your team.
